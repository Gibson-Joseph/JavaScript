//THE FOR LOOP:

//Loops are control structures.

//The loop will then run that code over and over again,until we tell it stop.
//for loob is a counter.

//the loop statement has three parts.

//for loop keeps running while condition is TRUE

//1st part is the initial value of counter. the counter is the value that will start at number one.

//2nd part, is a logical condition that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop.for loop keeps running while condition is TRUE

//3rd part is increasing the counter.

for (let rep = 1; rep <= 10; rep++) {
  //<-- rep=rep+1;
  console.log(`lifting weights reptition ${rep}`);
}
